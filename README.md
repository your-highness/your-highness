### Hi there 👋

Currently, I am working as a Clinical Bioinformatician at [Labor Berlin Charité Vivante GmbH](https://www.laborberlin.com). Before, I earned a PhD in Computational Epigenomics at Freie Universität Berlin / Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics.

- 💬 Ask me about IVD-R and I will not answer :smile:
